in-out-status
=============

This was created as a widget for the panic status board app.  The idea behind this widget was to show the availability
of the VCD instructors at EWU.  I used Jquery mobile for the toggle switches and I designed svg characters that correspond with each instructor.  The idea for this widget is for the instructors to let students know when they are in their office 
so design students do not have to climb 3 flights of stairs to find out if they are there or not.
